### Convolution Operation

The primary purpose of convolution is to find features in the image using the feature detector (filter/kernel), put them into a feature map that still preserves the spatial relationships between pixels

### ReLU Layer
### Pooling
### Flattening
### Full Connection
### Soft Max
### Cross Entropy
